# TO DO

##Features / functions
Get a pokemon by number

Search pokemon, autocomplete? js30 has good example for autocomplete
pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=802 gets all unique pokemon names - missing 803->809
display name and #
Pokemon cry? http://git.veekun.com/pokedex-media.git/tree/HEAD:/pokemon/cries has all the cries

##Design
This is a template idea
![](https://img.rankedboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Pokemon-Go-Pok%C3%A9dex-300x229.png)
sprite on left, detail on right, stats etc.
header?
searchbar seperate?

##Decisions
Responsive - two pages when screen is big enough but phone display?
How much info?
Autocomplete search - above? won't fit on pokedex
Shiny? Could do as boolean with button to flip switch
Front/back view? All pokemon seem to have it in sprites, could be boolean as above
