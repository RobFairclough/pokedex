#Pokédex

This pokedéx is a project for practising front-end development using React and the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). The project was inspired by a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ahtquu/learning_react_heres_my_first_go_at_it_a_pure_css/)

## Using the Pokédex

The Pokédex has a selector for choosing your pokémon, and two buttons above the sprite for altering the view. To select pokemon by number, type a number in to the inputbox and hit enter.

## Installing locally

To get a copy of the pokedex locally, fork/clone this repo to your local machine, run `npm install` in the project folder to install dependencies and run `npm start` to start a local version of the pokedex on your machine.

## Dependencies

This app was built using React 16.8.0, and requires a version of react at or above that, due to the hooks introduced in 16.8 which are used.

It also makes calls to the pokeapi through the wrapper library provided - Pokédex Promise v2 - requiring version 3.1.1 or above.
